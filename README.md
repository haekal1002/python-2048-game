# Python-2048
If you want to run directly from terminal just call 'python3 game.py'.
If you want to use the deb package, then:
  1. Install the deb package by using command 'Sudo apt-get install /path-to-file/2048-game.deb'
  2. After installation, use command '/file-path/game.py'. Use 'dpkg -L mypyscript' to see the file path.
